# Security Practices & Training Guide

## 1. Developer Security Training
- All developers should complete annual security training.
- Training should cover:
  - OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities (https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
  - Secure coding practices for JavaScript/TypeScript and SQL
  - Social engineering and phishing awareness
- Keep records of completed training for compliance.

## 2. Penetration Testing
- Schedule penetration tests at least annually, or after major releases.
- Use both automated tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Snyk, npm audit) and manual testing.
- Document all findings and remediation steps.
- Consider hiring a third-party security firm for unbiased testing.

## 3. Secure Development Lifecycle
- Review and update security policies quarterly.
- Perform code reviews with a focus on security.
- Use static analysis tools (ESLint, Snyk, Dependabot) to catch vulnerabilities early.

## 4. Incident Response
- Report and document any security incidents immediately.
- Review logs and audit trails for suspicious activity.
- Update training and policies based on lessons learned from incidents.
